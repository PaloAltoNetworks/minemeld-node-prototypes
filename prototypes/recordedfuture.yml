            The MasterRiskList miner downloads from Recorded Future a list of IP Addresses, domains, urls, or file hash
            with known risk. The risklist includes risk scores and the supporting evidence details. The miner can be configured
            to load a specific risklist; if no risklist is specified, the default risklist is used. The miner can also be
            configured to load a custom risklist from a user-specified Recorded Future file path; if no file path is
            specified, the default risklist file is used. To access this resource, you need a valid Recorded Future API token.
