    The BlockList project was created to become protection against negative 
    influence of the harmful and potentially dangerous events 
    on the Internet. First of all this service will help 
    internet and hosting providers to protect subscribers sites 
    from being hacked. BlockList will help to stop receiving a 
    large amount of spam from dubious SMTP relays or from 
    attempts of brute force passwords to servers and network 
    equipment.
