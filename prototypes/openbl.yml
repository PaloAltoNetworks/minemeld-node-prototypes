    The OpenBL.org project (formerly known as the SSH blacklist) is about
    detecting, logging and reporting various types of internet abuse. Currently
    our hosts monitor ports 21 (FTP), 22 (SSH), 23 (TELNET), 25 (SMTP),
    110 (POP3), 143 (IMAP), 587 (Submission), 993 (IMAPS) and 995 (POP3S)
    for bruteforce login attacks as well as scans on ports 80 (HTTP) and
    443 (HTTPS) for vulnerable installations of phpMyAdmin and other
    web applications.
