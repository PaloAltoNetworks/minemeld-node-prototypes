          From the website:
          The Feodo Tracker Feodo Domain Blocklist contains domain names (FQDN)
          used as C&C communication channel by the Feodo Trojan. These domains
          names are usually registered and operated by cybercriminals for the
          exclusive purpose of hosting a Feodo botnet controller. Hence you
          should expect no legit traffic to those domains. I highly recommend
          you to block/drop any traffic towards any Feodo C&C domain by using
          the Feodo Domain Blocklist. Please consider that domain names are
          usually only used by version B of the Feodo Trojan. C&C communication
          channels used by version A, version C and version D are not covered
          by this blocklist.

          From the website:
          The Feodo Tracker Feodo BadIP Blocklist only contains IP addresses
          (IPv4) used as C&C communication channel by the Feodo Trojan version
          B. These IP addresses are usually servers rented by cybercriminals
          directly and used for the exclusive purpose of hosting a Feodo C&C
          server. Hence you should expect no legit traffic to those IP
          addresses. I highly recommend you to block/drop any traffic towards
          any Feodo C&C using the Feodo BadIP Blocklist. Please consider that
          this blocklist only contains IP addresses used by version B of the
          Feodo Trojan. C&C communication channels used by version A, version
          C and version D are not covered by this blocklist.

          From the website:
          The Feodo Tracker Feodo IP Blocklist contains IP addresses (IPv4)
          used as C&C communication channel by the Feodo Trojan. This lists
          contains two types of IP address: Feodo C&C servers used by version
          A, version C and version D of the Feodo Trojan (these IP addresses
          are usually compromised servers running an nginx daemon on port 8080
          TCP or 7779 TCP that is acting as proxy, forwarding all traffic to a
          tier 2 proxy node) and Feodo C&C servers used by version B which are
          usually used for the exclusive purpose of hosting a Feodo C&C server.
          Attention: Since Feodo C&C servers associated with version A, version
          C and version D are usually hosted on compromised servers, its likely
          that you also block/drop legit traffic e.g. towards websites hosted
          on a certain IP address acting as Feodo C&C for version A, version C
          and version D. If you only want to block/drop traffic to Feodo C&C
          servers hosted on bad IPs (version B), please use the blocklist BadIPs.
