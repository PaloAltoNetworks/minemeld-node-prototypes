          From the website:
          Dridex and Emotet/Heodo botnet command&control servers (C&Cs) reside on
          a compromised server or a server that has been rent and setup by the 
          botnet herder itself for the sole purpose of botnet hosting. Feodo Tracker 
          offers a blocklist of IP addresses that are associated with such botnet 
          C&Cs which can be used to detect and block botnet C2 traffic from infected 
          machines towards the internet, leaving your network. An IP address will 
          only get added to the blocklist if it responds with a valid botnet C2 
          response. However, a botnet C2 may become offline later. The Botnet C2 
          IP Blocklist is available in different formats documented below.
